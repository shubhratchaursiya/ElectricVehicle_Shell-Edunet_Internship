# ElectricVehicle_Shell-Edunet_Internship

This repository contains work from **Week 1** of my internship on **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** under the Shell-Edunet program. It explores a dataset of EV charging stations and aims to deliver insight into the EV ecosystem through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

* **Dataset**: EV Charging Station data from Kaggle (link below)
* **Goal**: Clean, prepare, and analyze the dataset to understand trends and patterns in EV infrastructure
* **Tech Stack**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook
* **Scope (Week 1)**

  * Imported and cleaned the charging station dataset
  * Handled missing values and standardized data fields
  * Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  * Created visualizations to highlight station density, location distribution, and usage types
  * Documented observations and next steps
